My eyes slowly cracked open to the dim light of the sunrise through my curtains. It was a new dawn in a new year. My head was swimming with ideas of goals and ambitions for the next 365 days. My actions at that very moment could set the tone for the next chapter in my life. I jumped out of bed with little concern for personal safety and ran downstairs. Before I could act I needed fuel. I needed energy to power this walking and talking self-aware pattern called Daniel. I opened the fridge with such ambition it almost came off of the hinges. As I looked inside, my heart sank. Over the course of the holidays our fridge had slowly been depleted of sustenance. At first I almost panicked, but hidden behind some tupperware was my salvation. The food of the gods: corn flour tortillas.
