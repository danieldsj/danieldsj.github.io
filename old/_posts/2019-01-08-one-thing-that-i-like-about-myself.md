title: "One thing I love about myself"

The one thing I love about myself is my ability to deconstruct a problem. I think one of the reasons I was very good at troubleshooting
technical problems in my previous roles. I am not sure whether this trait was something I developed and nurtured or whether this is something
that I genetically predisposed with. According to (a study by Weili Jiang, Siyuan Shang, and Yanjie Su)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4602104/], it is plausible. Anyway, like many qualities, this is both a gift and a curse. I am praised for deconstructing and troubleshooting symptoms when it's called for, but doing it when it is unwelcome is not always appropriate and can result in awkward situations.
