Happy new year! One of my goals for this year is to write a lot more. I was made aware of this challenge which is a list of topics to write
about. I decided to take on the challenge, so here it goes.

My first meal of 2019 was as follows:
* Two eggs fried in avocado oil.
* Two corn flour tortillas, toasted.
* A mug of coffee with almond milk.

This breakfast is by far one of my favorite breakfasts because of its simplicity and practicality.

First, I start with the coffee. I make coffee one mug at a time with [a small pour over filter](https://www.amazon.ca/Harold-2661-Coffee-Filter-2-Cups/dp/B013S2HYHS/ref=sr_1_29?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1546651796&sr=1-29&keywords=pour+over+coffee+dripper). I buy flavoured coffee that is ground at the supermarket, and stick to french vanilla or hazelnut. I fill my kettle and set it to boil. My kettle is glass so I can quickly tell if there is too much calcium build-up.  The kettle is also has a wide mouth so that I can reach in and clean it if necessary.  Kettles with neither of these features and likely to be gross on the inside and cannot be cleaned, so I highly recommend these features when buying a kettle. As it boils I move on to the frying pan. 

Frying my eggs over hard is challenging because we use a ceramic pan instead of a teflon pan. When we adopted Kito the Budgie, we discovered that [Budgies are very sensitive to smells, specifically something included in Teflon](https://homekeethome.com/2017/03/31/please-dont-use-nonstick-cookware/), so we switched to ceramic. I find that ceramic pans do not perform as well as the teflon alternative. I typically put just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan.  This is way too much oil, but it is the only way to ensure that the egg does not stick to the surface. Once I have oiled the pan, I set the temperature to a medium heat and move onto the tortillas.

As the pan is heating up, I place two corn flour tortilla in the toaster oven. I set it to toast at the lightest setting. If you toast the tortilla too much they become hard and chewy.  It is important to toast it lightly. Leaving them in the warm toaster oven ensures that they don't cool down while I multitask, so I set it and forget it. I quickly pour the now boiling water in my coffee filter before moving to the eggs. 

My pan is big enough that I can do two eggs at a time, so I crack two eggs.  I cook them for about 2 minutes on the first side, and 4 minutes on the other side.  This is usually sufficient to cook most of the yoke for a over hard egg.  I turn off the heat and let the ambient temperature continue to cook the egg. I quickly pour the second bit of water into my drip filter before moving back to the tortillas.

I plate the tortillas and place each egg on top. I pat the eggs with a paper towel to absorb some of the oil. I then add some mustard on top with some salt and pepper. I use mustard because the label says it has zero calories and has ingredients that don't look like they came from a chemistry textbook.  I finish off the breakfast by adding almond milk to the coffee, and presto! Breakfast is served.
