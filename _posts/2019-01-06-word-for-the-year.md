My word of 2019 is presence. For several years I have developed a bad habit of idly browsing on my phone, and I must break this habit. I find that this habit becomes more and more difficult as technology advances and integrates with daily life. The speed at which a quick idea can manifest itself into several minutes of idle browsing is shocking. Even with the best of intentions, a person is only one link away from a distraction. I have tried different ways to curb this habit that has involved various apps and locking my phone in creative ways. I cannot count the number of times I have uninstalled the browser from my smartphone. I have even gone as far as purchasing a feature phone for myself (I forgot how much I hated T9). Despite my best efforts, I always went back to my phone.  The modern smartphone is simply too practical and economical to give up.

My strategy this year is going to work on associating and disassociating smartphone use with certain geographic locations where it's use is or isn't appropriate. I will restrict my idle phone time to when I am commuting to and from work on transit. Also, when I am at home, I plan to leave my phone by my television at all times. I will also stop using my phone as an alarm clock. I find that if the phone is beside my bed, I can very quickly jump on and get caught up in idle browsing when I should really be getting some sleep.

Presence isn't all about my idle phone browsing. It is also about the relationships in my life. In addition to taking all of the above steps, I am planning to do activities with my loved ones that do not involve technology.  With my brother I am going to plan some table top games. With my wife, I plan to take dancing lessons.  With my mother I plan to work on some sewing projects. All of these goals are very specific to each person in my life and deliberately do not involve technology which can be a real distraction.
